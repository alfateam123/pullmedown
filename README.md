some downloaders I wrote.

they are provided AS IS, and bugs could be around. just keep an eye on them.

* megatokyo
* batoto (start from the first, it will downloads all the available chapters)
* batoto (one chapter, you have to tell the image link and how many pages. modifiable for fakku)
* imgur (downloads albums. be sure you're using /a/ and not /gallery/ )
* imgur (creating a CBZ from the album you download)
* mangaeden (just one chapter at the time)
